                        I am 10 months old and I am extremely curious, I know the world through my nose. My goal in life
                        is to smell all the things I get, and create a database of smells. Did you know that I have a
                        super sense of smell? Don’t take me for granted, read more about this <a

                                I have a lot of fun in the backyard, which is my private kingdom. Here I play football,
                                it's actually more like a snoutball. But I also have other games, like chasing birds,
                                digging holes, running with cloth, solo tug of war, keeping the cats away, watching the
                                street and checking all the food deliveries of the day nearby. It is an awesome routine!

                            <p>
                                But the happiest part of the day is when my parents come to play with me, I love their
                                affection. I feel a bit sorry for them, because they don't have hair like me. And they
                                cannot use all their legs, but only two. They are funny people. I don't know why, but
                                every time I wag my tail they are smiling. I think they would like to have a tail too.
                                They keep throwing things away, but they stay very happy when I retrieve it.

                                Something I found strange was that I usually took them out for a walk. So they don't get
                                lost I let them tie a rope around me, so I pull them around. I used to sniff things and
                                wag my tail. Suddenly, they just stopped going for a walk, in return they stay at home
                                all day. I ended up enjoying it for now they are always around.
